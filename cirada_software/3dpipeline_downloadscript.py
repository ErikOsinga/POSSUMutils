"""
To be put on CANFAR /software/

Calls Sharon Goliath's download/ingest script ("possum_run_remote") to download
tiles from Australia to Canada (pawsey to CANFAR)


WORKFLOW:

1. Download files off pawsey and ingest them into CADC. This downloads the IQU cubes and MFS images
        possum_run_remote  

        possum_run_remote checks the CASDA archive (pawsey) for new observations and downloads them into the timeblocked directories

2. Go to the parent directory: /arc/projects/CIRADA/polarimetry/ASKAP/Tiles and create symbolic links from the timeblocked directories
        python create_symlinks.py

3. Processing will be done by run_3D_pipeline_intermittently.py
