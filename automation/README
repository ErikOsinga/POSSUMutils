Config.env must be populated with Prefect details for CANFAR session to connect to Prefect:

PREFECT_API_URL : IP address of the Prefect server e.g. http://<IP address>:4200/api
PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING : auth string to let us use the Prefect server in CANFAR

The rest of the values in config.env are now optional. All the secrets including database details are stored in Prefect server.

1. Github Actions Secrets:
--------------------------
HARBOR_PASSWORD : Harbor registry password to push images to run on Canfar
HARBOR_USERNAME : Harbor username to push images 
PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING : auth string to let us use the Prefect server in the code
PREFECT_API_URL : IP address of the Prefect server to bypass the OAuth Proxy (Github login)

2. Prefect secrets (under Blocks):
----------------------------------
cadc-proxy-pem | Generate cadcproxy.pem with CANFAR interactive session, and copy the content here. 
database-host | POSSUM database IP address
database-name | POSSUM database name
database-password |  POSSUM database password
database-port |  POSSUM database port
database-user |  POSSUM database username
possum-status-sheet |  link to POSSUM status Google spreadsheet
possum-status-token |  Copy the content of the json token to access the possum-status-sheet above

3. Prefect variables (under Variables):
---------------------------------------
Optional, only if you'd like to override these values:
canfar-num-retries | 2 | Number of retries when CANFAR session fails.
canfar-polling-interval-seconds | 60 | Polling interval (in seconds) to poll CANFAR sessions. 

We need to poll CANFAR periodically because sometimes the sessions silently terminate, and Prefect does not know about it. 
Now we'll retry before giving up, and raising an error so to propagate as Prefect flow failure, and send Slack notification.

You can still use your own config.env as below to override the production secrets for testing purposes.
1. Rename config.env.example to config.env.
2. Enter ausSRC database details in the .env file. 
3. Enter Google spreadsheet token
4. Update Google spreadsheet file locations (only if the files are different, e.g. for testing)
